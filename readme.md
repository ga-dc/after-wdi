# Life After WDI

# Outcomes

Portfolio Standup - Next Tuesday, August 16th

# Stay Hungry

The journey doesn't end here. There's always...
* More to learn.
* A better way to do what you're trying to do.
* Entire worlds and paradigms in programming that you've probably never heard of, let alone understand.

## Become Mediocre

That is, surround yourself with better developers.

### Work

Work will be one way to do this. Chances are you will be part of a team with higher-level developers who have been in the industry for years. Don't pass up on learning their tricks of the trade.

> Some of you might end up working somewhere where you're the only -- and therefore the most experienced -- developer on the team!

### Outside of Work

Learn from people outside of work, whether that's IRL at meet-ups and conferences or through online communities (e.g., GitHub, StackOverflow, social media).

### Mentorship

The good news is that there are lots of people who know a lot about programming, and may be willing to mentor you. Finding a mentor isn't easy, but some things might help...

#### Work in the Open

* People giving feedback on a github commit is valuable and could lead to longer discussions on code.
* Answer questions on StackOverflow.
* People are more willing to help those who help others.

#### Serve as a Mentor for Others

* Many of you are fortunate to have some structured ways in which you'll be helping others. For those of you who don't, seek out organizations devoted to helping people. They often have training and resources.
* Teaching is a fantastic way to improve your skills.
* People are more willing to help those who help others.


### Other Ways to Stay Hungry

* Find an "accountabili-buddy" and set measurable, achievable goals for each other.
* Walk through [leveling up as a developer](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/).
* Read a book.
* Read the source code for a framework or tool that you have used.
* Root cause analysis: every bug you fix is a level up, but you have to understand why it happened.
* Listen to podcasts like [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues) and [Javascript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber).

> Never stop learning. Keep that mind sharp. This is important not only for the time between now and your first job, but for the rest of your life.

# Stay Focused

After WDI I felt like an imposter, and that despite all I had learned I still wasn't qualified to be employed anywhere.

I was going to a couple meetups a week and interacting with developers that had many more years of experience than me. They made me keenly aware of how little I knew out of the total knowledge out there relating to programming and left me  hungry to learn more. I felt wan looking at the projects and products of the companies that I wanted to work for. To me it seemed like I had to be as good as other developers before anyone would even consider paying me to do anything.

My stress about finding a job and my insecurities about my skills set me adrift. My time was divided and unfocused, a few hours learning about CS fundamentals, a few improving my old projects, a few starting new projects, a few looking up jobs, a few at home, a few at GA, a few at coffee shops.

I was trying to do everything at once and as a result didn't make much progress on anything. If I was to do it over again I would have spent the time prior to the meet and hire focused completely on improving my old projects. Then after the meet and hire spent as much time as possible applying to jobs and interviewing.


# Confidence and the Job Search

## Framing What You Don't Know

Being able to express what you don't know if an important skill to have, especially in job interviews. The Washington Post, for example, use their phone screen as an opportunity to identify what you don't know.

How do you go about doing that?
* Talk about what you've learned.
* Talk about the obstacles you've overcome.
* Talk about when you failed.
* Talk about how you will learn what you don't know.

> You've had a lot of experiences here - leverage those experiences as you progress forward.

## Confidence

Most graduates don't struggle with a lack of knowledge or understanding, but more a lack of confidence!
* Think about where you were 12 weeks ago. What about 6, even 3? I interviewed all of you, so I know!
* Think about how much you will be learning from here on out.

> Confidence is huge -- trust yourself and trust what you are able to accomplish,
