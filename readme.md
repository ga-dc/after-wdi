# Life After WDI

# A Word From Outcomes

# Stay Hungry

The journey doesn't end here. There's always...
* More to learn.
* A better way to do what you're trying to do.
* Entire worlds and paradigms in programming that you've probably never heard of, let alone understand.

### Become Mediocre

That is, surround yourself with better developers.

#### Work

Work will be one way to do this for many of you, but you may not be so lucky, and at some point, you may be the best developer at your company (crazy, right?)

#### Non-work Peers

Attend meetups, conferences, etc.

#### Mentorship

The good news is that there are lots of people who know a lot about programming, and may be willing to mentor you.

Finding a mentor isn't easy, but some things might help...
* Work in the open
	* People giving feedback on a github commit is valuable and could lead to longer discussions on code.
	* People are more willing to help those who help others.
* Serve as a mentor for others
  * Many of you are fortunate to have some structured ways in which you'll be helping others. For those of you who don't, seek out organizations devoted to helping people. They often have training and resources.
  * Teaching is a fantastic way to improve your skills.
	* People are more willing to help those who help others.

### Other Ways to Stay Hungry

* Find an "accountabili-buddy" and use them to set measurable, achievable goals for yourself.
* Walk through [leveling up as a developer](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/).
* Experience the ins and outs of programming for different platforms.
* Enhance your understanding of the building blocks that we use as developers.
* Enlighten yourself with koans, katas, and the wisdom of ages.
* Read a book.
* Read source code (i.e. for rails, backbone, underscore, or anything that you use).
* Every bug you fix is a level up, but you have to understand why it happened. (Root cause analysis)
* Listen to podcasts (e.g., Ruby Rogues, Javascript Jabber).
* Understand that all programming happens in a domain. Learn the domain you're working in well, and own it.

# Stay Focused

After WDI I felt like an imposter, and that despite all I had learned I still wasn't qualified to be employed anywhere.

I was going to a couple meetups a week and interacting with developers that had many more years of experience than me. They made me keenly aware of how little I knew out of the total knowledge out there relating to programming and left me  hungry to learn more. I felt wan looking at the projects and products of the companies that I wanted to work for. To me it seemed like I had to be as good as other developers before anyone would even consider paying me to do anything.

My stress about finding a job and my insecurities about my skills set me adrift. My time was divided and unfocused, a few hours learning about CS fundamentals, a few improving my old projects, a few starting new projects, a few looking up jobs, a few at home, a few at GA, a few at coffee shops.

I was trying to do everything at once and as a result didn't make much progress on anything. If I was to do it over again I would have spent the time prior to the meet and hire focused completely on improving my old projects. Then after the meet and hire spent as much time as possible applying to jobs and interviewing.


# Confidence and the Job Search

* Framing what you don't know
	* Washington Post Example - goal of phone screen is to identify what you don't know.
	* How will you frame what you don't know?
		* Talk about what you've learned
		* Talk about the obsticales that you've overcame
		* Talk about when you failed
		* Talk about how you will learn what you don't know
	* You've had a lot of experiences here - leverage those experiences as you progress forward
* Confidence
	* Most graduates don't struggle with a lack of knownledge or understanding, but more a lack of confidence!
	* Think about what you have learned in 12 weeks
		*Think about where you were 12 weeks ago. 6 weeks ago, etc. (I interviewed all of you, so I know!)
	*Think about all the things that you will continue to learn as a developer
	*Confidence is huge -- trust yourself and trust what you are able to accomplish
